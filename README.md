# foiled

> "Foiled structures" is an anagram of what this project aims to be: a [Discourse](https://discourse.org) client written in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)

Foiled is still in early development. A roadmap is coming soon here, or to the Projects tab, of what needs to be accomplished.

## Goals

- caching, offline access to browsing and seraching discourse servers
- handling multiple accounts (and servers) well
- quality over quantity; "negative code"
- performance and beauty, using [M3](https://m3.material.io)
- [SemVer](https://semver.org) versioning, where the user interface is the "API"

## Non-goals

- any feature that writes to the server (eg. replying, posting, etc. only for now)
- admin access
- web support: working with databases with this tech on web is complicated, and the discourse web client is fine (although if you want to work on this, feel free to)

## Code style & dev information

- use [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev) where possible
- negative code = better code
- use expressions instead of function bodies
- use the tenary operator for an one-level if else, but nothing more
- `LinearProgressIndicator` looks nicer than `CircularProgressIndicator` in most places
- don't make spaghetti widgets, use private classes instead.
- unix philosophy to the max, in the code too: **each function, class, provider, and whatever should do one thing, but that well**.
- I am experimenting with [Feature-first structure](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-project-structure/). I am not sure how much it'll help yet.
- reading and following the advice of [The Grug Brain Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/) is **highly encouraged**
  - highlights:
    - [Logging](https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-logging) -> should basically log anything that lives to make debugging easier
    - **Bundle stuff together**

## Useful stuff

- [Discourse API Docs](https://docs.discourse.org/)
- [User API key generation](https://meta.discourse.org/t/user-api-keys-specification/48536)
  - example auth URL can be found in `assets/test_keys/url.txt`
- during development, you can use `flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` to automatically call codegen on file changes
ajo
- [JSON Hero](https://jsonhero.io) has also proved very useful. [Give them a star](https://github.com/apihero-run/jsonhero-web) if you want.
- Database
  - object's `Id`s should be **a hash of the query url** for easy discoverability and reusability
  
  - schema-ish of how I envision :
